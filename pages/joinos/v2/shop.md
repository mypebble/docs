## Shop for Joinos v2

### Goals

* Improve the current user experience for "offers"
* Reduce steps needed to pay for items
* Increase options available for items in the store

### Background and strategic

The current system calls items in the school's store-front "offers", which is
slightly misleading and confusing to parents.

Currently the schools would like to add items such as school uniform onto their
store-front, however Joinos does not provide good enough options to enable this
to happen. This feature would add options for sizing, categories and imagery
for store items. This would increase the feature set in Joinos and make it more
valuable to schools.

Paying for items currently has a very basic flow of adding an item to the
basket, and then going to the checkout page and completing the checkout there.
Also when an item is added to a basket, the parent is not given any further
instruction on what to do now they have added it to their basket. This feature
will improve the flow for parents so that when an item is added to a basket the
user is given direction of where to go next, similar to Amazon and other
online retailers.

Also with this feature including payment providers which have the ability for
us to reuse card details securely. This feature will allow us to make checkout
faster as we can ask parents if they want to just use the same payment method
as they have used previously within a timeframe specified by our payment providers.

We will also add support for another payment provider we going to be moving to.

### Assumptions

* Users may use this on a mobile, tablet or laptop
* Users won't receive training or documentation in advance of using this feature

### Questions

* **Q:** For adding variations to products, will schools understand or need
  the idea of SKUs?
* **Q:** How do schools currently manage inventory and delivery? Would it be
  useful for Fund Manager to manage this for schools?
